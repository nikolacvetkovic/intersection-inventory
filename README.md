Web app for management data of intersections equipped with traffic lights

My work is Java with Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL

All HTML, CSS and JavaScript is from http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page202/boss and I changed them in accordance with the needs

Goals:

1. add spring security (DONE)
2. split "insert" and "update" in two separate Controllers (DONE)
4. implement DAO pattern with Generic classes (DONE)
5. optimize JSP pages (DONE)
6. export data to .xlsx - Apache POI (DONE)
7. add Ajax (checks user input in all forms then sends post request) (Transfer to branch: Move from XML to Java Config)
